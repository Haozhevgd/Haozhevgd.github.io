            <h2>History of milk</h2>
            <p>
                Milk has been a vital part of human diets for thousands of years, 
                dating back to around 6000 BCE when early agricultural societies 
                in the Middle East first domesticated animals like cows, goats, 
                and sheep for dairy production. Over time, milk became a staple food source across various cultures 
                due to its rich nutritional value. Advances in farming, refrigeration, and pasteurization throughout 
                history have made milk safer and more widely available. Today, milk continues to be a key 
                ingredient in many traditional diets and a base for numerous dairy products worldwide.
